So, after hand crafting my [first site](https://web.archive.org/web/20010607053253/http://www.boney.clara.net/about_me.html) way back in 1999 (and waffling on about [robotics](https://web.archive.org/web/20010607055543/http://www.boney.clara.net/mable/)), I'm having another crack at publishing my thoughts and musings.  I'm a little older, wiser and greyer and hopefully a little more interesting ;-)
