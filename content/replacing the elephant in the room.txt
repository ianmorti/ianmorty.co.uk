Having [ditched the elephant](http://ianmorty.co.uk/post/kicking-the-evernote-habbit), I needed a way of storing all my notes and other snippets of information that was based on plain text and had some simple way of structuring documents.

## Current Setup

As of today, I currently have 1649 plain text documents in a folder on my Dropbox account.  They range in size from 423944 bytes (a file containing annotated log entries for a particular issue involving DNS failures in the product I work on) to 7 bytes (a file containing two unicode characters that I use for sucking up into REST requests when testing API's).  Most of the files here are in markdown format with the rest being either pure plain text, org-mode or some other formatting.

I have several ways of getting text in and out of these files depending on where I am, what I'm doing and what "tool" is closest to hand.

When I'm on my macbook pro at work, I'm living in emacs all day so I've configured my Dropbox directory as a projectile project (by simply placing a `.projectile` in the directory) and then using the amazing [helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm) with [helm-projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile#helm-integration) integration to find what I want either by name or using `helm-projectile-ag` for content.

The relevant bit of my `.emacs.d/init.el`:

    (projectile-global-mode)
	(setq projectile-completion-system 'helm)
	(setq projectile-enable-caching t)
	(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-p") 'helm-projectile)

When on my other macs at home, I'll use nvAlt to find what I want or if I'm on the command line, a quick `ag` to search or STDOUT redirection to insert will suffice.

On my iOS devices, I flick between Byword and 1writer depending on my mood.

The filenames are all lower case ascii characters with spaces, are typically consists of several words to forma a sentence to describe the content or purpose of the file.  I use the `.txt` file extension the apps I use all interpret that as a markdown file.
